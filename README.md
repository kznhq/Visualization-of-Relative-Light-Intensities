# Visualization-of-Relative-Light-Intensities
- Code for an academic project from November - December 2022
- This project utilized a Photon microcontroller and C++ code.
- Worked on this with a partner. I worked on most of the software engineering and coding work while my partner worked on the hardware and also helped with the brainstorming of how to convert our ideas into software principles.
