# Visualization-of-Relative-Light-Intensities
- Code for an academic project from November - December 2022
- This project utilized a Photon microcontroller on a breadboard that also included a light sensor, push button, and 3 LEDs. A Blynk IoT mobile app was also used to display the readings of the sensor.
- Worked on this with a partner, I worked on most of the software engineering and coding work.
